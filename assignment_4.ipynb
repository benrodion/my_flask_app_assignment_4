    "\n",
    "There exist several ways of ordering the jobs:   \n",
    "- shortest processing time first: order jobs in ascending order of processing time $t_j$ (smallest jobs first)\n",
    "- earliest deadline first: order jobs in ascending order of $d_j$  \n",

    "The optimal approach with regard to our problem is an **earliest-deadline-first-greedy-algorithm** (EDF), which provides us with an optimal schedule with no idle (i.e. unused) time. The algorithm therefore sorts all jobs such that $d_1 ≤ d_2 ... ≤ d_j$ (hence the name) and jobs are processed in a way that never leaves the agent/processor (or whoever is tasked with the jobs) idle. Why is this optimal? The optimality of this solution can be proved via Lemma's Exchange Argument. Suppose we have an \"optimal\" non-EDF schedule of jobs S, which since it is non-EDF, will contain at least one _inversion_. An inversion is a pair of jobs $j_i$ and $j_k$ such that i < k (w.r.t. their deadlines), but $j_k$ is scheduled before $j_i$. Swapping the two consecutive, inverted jobs reduces the number of inversions by one and does _not_ increase maximum lateness, as the sum is commutative. If we swap the two jobs such that $j_i$ is processed before $j_k$ maximum lateness can only stay the same or decrease, it _cannot_ increase. Hence, removing all inversions will give us an EDF-order of jobs without increasing maximum lateness. In fact, it decreases it.  \n",
